This blog will (hopefully) be a collection of posts that accompany github projects, explaining in a little more detail the ins and outs of the project and how it came to be. Currently, I imagine it will be heavily AI focused (with projects revolving around GAN's & CNN's) and just algorithms in general, but it may also be a variety of other things such as drone firmware & audio fingerprinting.
